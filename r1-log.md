## Log

### R1D0 - June 18th, 2018.

I wrote a small script to automate the login to a Django application and save to a txt file the cookie that was generated.

### R1D1 - June 19th, 2018.

**Today's Progress**: I wrote a small script to visit the Django Girls website and get a list of cities that have hosted workshops. As of now, this list is exported to a txt file. I hope to work on exporting it to CSV and JSON next.

### R1D2 - June 20th, 2018.

**Today's Progress**: The script now exports the data from that list to a csv or to a JSON file. I used another module ([sys](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html)) from Python. installed and used [PyLint](https://www.pylint.org) to check my code.
