# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: June 18th, 2018.

**Today's Progress**: I reviewed how to write list comprehensions in Python (thanks, Elias!) and I also reviewed how to setup the enviroment with the new pipenv, a new skill I learned not long ago when I participated in the Grupy-RN meetup. I read a bit Selenium's documentation and wrote a small script to automate the login to a Django application and save to a txt file the cookie that was generated. The first time I used Selenium, I wrote a script to the Chrome webdrive, but this time I wanted to change things a bit, so I used Firefox's (Gecko) webdriver.

**Thoughts:** I installed PyCharm and played with it for a bit, thanks to a license I was gifted during Python Nordeste. It's a bit strange to get used to using an IDE to develop. It seems this ability can be useful in the long run when I work on more complex projects, but... it takes a bit to get used to all the options and possibilities that come with it. About the code: I look forward to learning more about Selenium and using it with Python and other languages to automate boring tasks that should never be done manually.
